# Event:
#### W hen you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this just happened." Your script can then respond to these events. 
## DIFFERENT EVENT TYPES 
1. UIEVENTS Occur when a user interacts with the browser's user interface (UI) rather than the web page 
2. KEYBOARD EVENTS Occur when a user interacts with the keyboard (see also input event) 
3. MOUSE EVENTS Occur when a user interacts with a mouse. trackpad, or touchscreen 
4. FOCUS EVENTS Occur when an element (e.g., a link or form field) gains or loses focus 
5. FORM EVENTS Occur when a user interacts with a form element 
6. MUTATION EVENTS*  Occur when the DOM structure has been changed by a script 

### When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code. Together these steps are known as event handling. 
>  handling can be used to provide feedback to users filling in a registration form. It will show an error message if their username is too short.
