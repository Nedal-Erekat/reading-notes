### What Css dose?
#### CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.
#### to understand how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

### Style Rules

####  A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. And the CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. As you can see from the above figure.

CSS Selector
CSS selectors are used to select the content you want to style. Selectors are the part of CSS rule set. CSS selectors select HTML elements according to its id, class, type, attribute etc.
* There are several different types of selectors in CSS.

### *STATEMENTS* : A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 

 
### WHAT IS A VARIABLE?

### DATA TYPES 
#### JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans. 

### CREATING AN ARRAY
