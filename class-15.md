1. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’

The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.

We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy.We want to know that work is more than just labor.
