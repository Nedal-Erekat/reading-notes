# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.


## Undirected Graphs
An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

## Directed Graphs (Digraph)
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

## Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

## Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

## Disconnected
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

## Cyclic Graphs
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

1. Graph Representation
We represent graphs through:

Adjacency Matrix
Adjacency List

2. Weighted Graphs
A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights. This is what a weighted graph looks like:


### Real World Uses of Graphs
Graphs are extremely popular when it comes to it’s uses. Here are just a few examples of graphs in use:

1. GPS and Mapping
1. Driving Directions
1. Social Networks
1. Airline Traffic
1. Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
