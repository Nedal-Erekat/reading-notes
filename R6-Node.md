> Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine
#### This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

## Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager
#### Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type `npm -v`.


## Installing a Package Globally
#### Open your terminal and type the following:
```
npm install -g jshint
```
## What Is Node.js Used For?

#### And if you want to start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular), you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of Node and npm (or maybe Yarn). This isn’t because you need a Node back end to run these frameworks. You don’t. Rather, it’s because these frameworks (and many, many related packages) are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.

1. Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server
2. The Node.js Execution Model
 - everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.
3. it can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC.
4. write your own command line tool
5.  build cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots.

## What Kind of Apps Is Node.js Suited To?
#### Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database), or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded.

## What Are the Advantages of Node.js?
1. speed and scalability
2. can do everything in the same language.
 * For example, you can easily share code between the server and the client.
3. it speaks JSON
 * data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.
4. JavaScript is ubiquitous: This means that transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages.
