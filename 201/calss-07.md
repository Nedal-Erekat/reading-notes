#### A constructor enables you to provide any custom initialization that must be done before any other methods can be called on an instantiated object.
#### The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects.Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates. 
#### If you want to access items via a property name or key, use an object (but note that each key in the object must be unique). If the order of the items is important, use an array.
