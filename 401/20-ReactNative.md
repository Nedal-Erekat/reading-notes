# React Native
react native it is like react can use props and state and it could be functionaly and class component 

there is no difference in handling the state between React and React Native, You can use the state of your components both in classes and in functional components using hooks

## Ejecting to ExpoKit
ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or react-native init.

Normally, Expo apps are written in pure JS and never "drop down" to the native iOS or Android layer. This is core to the Expo philosophy and it's part of what makes Expo fast and powerful to use.
