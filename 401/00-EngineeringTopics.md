## How to Solve Programming Problems
- You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.

### A simple set of steps:
 1. Read the problem completely twice.
  * “Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”

 1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
 1. Optimize the manual steps.
 1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
 1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
 1. Optimize the real code.
### divide and conquer
- Many times you will find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated.  In those instances, you will want to try and find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process above for each half.


## How you value your time is how you value your life
> “Most people have no clue what they are doing with their time but still complain that they don’t have enough.” 
> “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness
> “People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.” 
> “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”

- If you don’t manage your time, it will manage you.
#### What you think is what you become. If you think your time is worth a few bucks an hour, that you’ll begin to act like it. You’ll find yourself saying “yes” to meaningless, pointless obligations.

> “The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.”
### So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?Here are the steps:
1. Understand
2. Plan
 * “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
3. Divide
    * Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.
    * Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
    > Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.” — V. Anton Spraul
4. Stuck?
* Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging 
* Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
* Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

## Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

####  "Quick fixes" may seem convenient, but they often solve only the surface issues and waste resources that could otherwise be used to tackle the real cause.
## The 5 Whys Technique

#### The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

> Note:
`The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures," rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring.`


## How to Use the 5 Whys
1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
 - Ask your team why the problem is occurring.
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
 - Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.
7. Monitor Your Measures

> Key Points
 The 5 Whys strategy is a simple, effective tool for uncovering the root of a problem. You can use it in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and quality-improvement initiatives.

 Start with a problem and ask why it is occurring. Make sure that your answer is grounded in fact, and then ask the question again. Continue the process until you reach the root cause of the problem, and you can identify a counter-measure that will prevent it from recurring.

 Bear in mind that this questioning process is best suited to simple or moderately difficult problems. Complex problems may benefit from a more detailed approach, although using 5 Whys will still give you useful insights.
