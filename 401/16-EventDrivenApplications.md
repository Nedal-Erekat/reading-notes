# Event DrivenApp lications
Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article we’re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.

Every time you interact with a webpage through it’s user interface, an event is happening. When you click a button a click event is triggered. When you press a key a keydown event is triggered. These events have associated functions that, when triggered, are executed to make a change to the user interface in some way.

- Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:

 - An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
 - A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

## EventEmitter
Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away. Of course, creating our own version of EventEmitter wouldn’t be much of a challange, and in fact there are several modules published on npm such as EventEmitter2 and EventEmitter3 which promise a faster performance than the native EventEmitter.

Those are both worth checking out if your project needs to run faster than EventEmitter will allow. They are both built to allow for syntax that is almost identical to what we’ll use for EventEmitter so learning one will make it easy to work with all of them.

We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported we’ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.
