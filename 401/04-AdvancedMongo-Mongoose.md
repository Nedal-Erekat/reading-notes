## Data Modeling
![data](https://www.guru99.com/images/1/022218_0657_WhatisDataM1.png)
- Why would a developer choose to make data models?
1. modeling helps in the visual representation of data. Data Models ensure consistency in naming conventions, default values, semantics, security while ensuring quality of the data.

1. Ensures that all data objects required by the database are accurately represented. Omission of data will lead to creation of faulty reports and produce incorrect results.

1. A data model helps design the database at the conceptual, physical and logical levels.

1. Data Model structure helps to define the relational tables, primary and foreign keys and stored procedures.

1. It provides a clear picture of the base data and can be used by database developers to create a physical database.

1. It is also helpful to identify missing and redundant data.

1. Though the initial creation of data model is labor and time consuming, in the long run, it makes your IT infrastructure upgrade and maintenance cheaper and faster.

## CRUD
 - used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information, often using computer-based forms and reports. 

## Postgres vs MongoDB
- Postgres is a `relational database` management system and it has another name postgreSQL.
- MongoDB is a cross-platform d`ocument-oriented database` program. Classified as a `NoSQL database program`, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

## What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
- Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB
>  it speeds up application development and reduces the complexity of deployments.

## list of Diffenition:
- database: A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. 
- data model: organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
- CRUD:create, read, update, and delete are the four basic functions of persistent storage. 
- schema:  the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed. 
- sanitize: remove any illegal character from the data. make the data secure
- Structured Query Language (SQL): for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.
- Non SQL (NoSQL):are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. 
- MongoDB: is a cross-platform d`ocument-oriented database` program. Classified as a `NoSQL database program`, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
- Mongoose: is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB
- record: is composed of fields and contains all the data about one particular person, company, or item in a database.
- document: is a type of nonrelational database that is designed to store and query data as JSON-like documents.
- Object Relation Mapping (ORM): converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages.
