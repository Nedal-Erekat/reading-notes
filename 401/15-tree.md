# Trees
### Common Terminology
- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
- Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
- Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
- Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
- Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Traversals
An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

1. Depth First
  - Pre-order: root >> left >> right
  - In-order: left >> root >> right
  - Post-order: left >> right >> root

2. Breadth First
  - Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node


## Binary Trees
In all of our examples, we’ve been using a Binary Tree. Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).

## Binary Search Trees
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
 - Searching a BST
Searching a BST can be done quickly, because all you do is compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree. If the value is smaller, you only traverse the left side. If the value is larger, you only traverse the right side.
