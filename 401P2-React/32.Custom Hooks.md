# Custom Hooks
A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks.

Five Important Rules for Hooks

1. Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function
2. Hooks should sit at the top-level of your component
3. Only call Hooks from React functional components
4. Never call a Hook from a regular function
5. Hooks can call other Hooks

### Context
-  Context allows this sharing of values between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

### useReducer
useReducer now. It takes state and action as arguments. 
```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
```
