# Hashtables
## What is a Hashtable?
Kind of the datastructuer, every element containes from key and value pairs and the element could be like a linked list

Terminology:

1. Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
2. Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
3. Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.


## Structure
- Hashing
The basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. This is done through what we call a hash. A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value. 

Basically, a hash code turns a key into an integer. It’s very important that hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input. Hash codes should never have randomness to them. The same key should always produce the same hash code.




- Creating a Hash
A hashtable traditionally is created from an array. I always like the size 1024. this is important for index placement. After you have created your array of the appropriate size, do some sort of logic to turn that “key” into a numeric number value. Here is a possible suggestion:

Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
Insert into the array at that index.

## Collisions
What would happen if two different keys resolved to be the same index of the array? This is called a collision. The hash map needs to be able to handle two keys resolving to the same index.

- Hash maps do this to store values:

accept a key
calculate the hash of the key
use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list

- Hash maps do this to read value:

accept a key
calculate the hash of the key
use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given
